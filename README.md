# c8_w4_PML_Coursera
Repository containing all submission material for final project of the course

Here you'll find: 

(i) a .pdf file of the final project 
(ii) a .html page as required 
(iii) the full .Rmd R Markdown file used to generate the above 
(iv) my blood, sweat and tears and love for citations 

Please note that 42 is a great number to choose to set a seed. You know why, don't you? 
If not, repent and go read Douglas Adam's "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". 

Thanks for your patience. 

Best, 

FA
